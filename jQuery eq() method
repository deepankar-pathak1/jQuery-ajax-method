jQuery eq() method
The eq() method in jQuery returns an element with the given index. 
This method reduces the set of elements to the one with a specific index. The index can either be positive or negative.
If we use a negative index, the index count starts from the end of the list of selected elements.

Suppose we have a jQuery object representing the set of elements, so the eq() method constructs a new JQuery object that contains one element of that set.

This eq() method is same as index method that we have learnt in python.

$(selector).eq(index)  

index: It is the mandatory parameter that specifies the element's index. 
It can be specified as a positive or negative number. 
The negative index causes an index count to be started from the end of the list rather than the beginning. 
It always starts with the 0 position, so the index value of the first value is 0 instead of 1.

<head>
<title> jQuery eq() method </title>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function() {
$(".para").eq(1).css({ "color": "red", "fontSize": "20px", "fontWeight": "bold" });
$(".para").eq(3).css({ "color": "blue", "fontSize": "20px", "fontWeight": "bold" });
});
</script>
</head>

<body>
<h3> This is an example of using the eq() method. </h3>
<h4> Index always starts with 0, so the position of first value is 0 instead of 1. </h4>
<p class = "para"> First Paragraph </p>
<p class = "para"> Second Paragraph </p>
<p class = "para"> Third Paragraph </p>
<p class = "para"> Fourth Paragraph </p>
<p class = "para"> Fifth Paragraph </p>
</body>
