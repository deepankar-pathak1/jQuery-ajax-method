if ($('input[name=gender]:checked').length > 0) {
    // do something here
}
Let me break that down into pieces to cover it more clearly. jQuery processes things from left to right.

input[name=gender]:checked

input limits it to input tags.

[name=gender] limits it to tags with the name gender within the previous group.

:checked limits it to checkboxes/radio buttons that are selected within the previous group.

If you want to avoid this altogether, mark one of the radio buttons as checked (checked="checked") in the HTML code, which would guarantee that one radio button is always selected.
